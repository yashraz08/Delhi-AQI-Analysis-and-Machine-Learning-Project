# Delhi AQI Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This project aims to analyze the air quality data of Delhi using Python and develop a machine learning model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). The project is divided into two parts:  
1. **Data Analysis**: The first part involves cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing the AQI data to derive meaningful insights.
2. **Machine Learning**: The second part involves building and training a machine learning model to predict AQI based on various features.

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Python** libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn** to perform data analysis and machine learning. The dataset used in this project contains real-time data on AQI from various locations in Delhi, capturing parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and more.

### Key Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Building and Training a Machine Learning Model (Regression/Classification)
- Evaluation of Model Performance

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based development environment for Python

## Files and Notebooks:
The main Jupyter notebook for this project is located in the following file:
- `awp+ml.ipynb`: This notebook contains both the data analysis and machine learning code, including data exploration, cleaning, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started:
To run the project on your local machine or in Google Colab:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine or open the notebook in Google Colab:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashraz08/Delhi-AQI-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Project.git
```

### Step 2: Open in Google Colab
- Click on the link to open the notebook directly in Google Colab:
  [Delhi AQI Analysis and Machine Learning Project - awp+ml.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yashraz08/Delhi-AQI-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/awp%2Bml.ipynb)

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries (if running locally)
If running the notebook locally, install the required libraries by using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Step 4: Run the Notebook
- Execute the cells in the notebook to run the analysis and train the model.

## Results:
The notebook presents data visualizations that highlight the trends in air quality over time, relationships between various pollutants, and predictions for AQI based on the given features.

## Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R² score** to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

## Conclusion:
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Delhi’s air quality and demonstrates the use of machine learning in predicting AQI levels. By leveraging the power of Python and machine learning, the project offers valuable insights into air pollution and its impact on public health.
